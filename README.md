# 🔐 LangExchangeEscrow Smart Contract

## 📘 Description

The `LangExchangeEscrow` contract is a simple, trustless escrow system built on the Aptos blockchain. It is designed to facilitate secure peer-to-peer **language exchange agreements** between two users, where both parties deposit a fixed amount of tokens into escrow before beginning the exchange.

This contract ensures **mutual commitment** from both users by locking funds on-chain, promoting accountability in informal educational exchanges.

## 🎯 Vision

The vision behind this smart contract is to enable **trustless collaboration** in global language learning communities. By requiring both parties to commit tokens, it:
- Ensures seriousness and accountability from both sides.
- Eliminates the risk of one party ghosting or failing to deliver after the other has invested time.
- Sets the foundation for **decentralized, secure, and incentive-aligned language exchanges**.

## 🔮 Future Scope

This contract can be extended and improved with the following features:
- **Fund Release Mechanism**: Automatically or manually release funds upon session completion or mutual agreement.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Introduce a mediator or DAO-based voting mechanism to resolve conflicts.
- **Rating System**: Let users rate each other post-session, building reputation.
- **Session Scheduling and History Tracking**: Store timestamps, session counts, and history of interactions.
- **Dynamic Deposits**: Allow users to specify different deposit amounts or use other token types.
